    <p>Our lab is located in the ICS Tower in ICS 225. We have plenty of resources for engineers to make use of, including two circuit stations (with oscilloscopes, multimeters, etc.), a soldering station, and breadboards and various of circuit components.</p>
    <p>Even if you don't need any of these, you can always drop by to work on projects, seek advice from upperclassmen, or just spend some quality time with other IEEE@UCI engineers!</p>
